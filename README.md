# 🔍 Fake Social Media Account Detection System

This project aims to detect fake social media accounts based on data patterns and behaviors using machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of a final-year BE project and was selected for the *Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST)* initiative, receiving a grant of ₹3500.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Fake accounts on social platforms often pose security threats, spread misinformation, and impact real user engagement. This system detects suspicious or fake accounts based on attributes such as:

- Number of followers
- Engagement metrics (likes/comments)
- Profile completeness
- Posting frequency
- Content quality indicators

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- *Random Forest Classifier*
- *Decision Tree Classifier*
- *Logistic Regression*

  
Each model was trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. The Random Forest model showed the highest performance in terms of accuracy.
